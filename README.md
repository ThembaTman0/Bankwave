# Bankwave - Accounts Microservice

## Overview
Bankwave is a **Spring Boot microservice** designed to manage **account-related functionality** such as creating, retrieving, and updating account details. It forms part of a modular microservices architecture, built to demonstrate scalability, resilience, and deployment readiness in modern enterprise environments.

This project was adapted and extended from a structured microservices learning path, but tailored to showcase **production-grade practices** and align with enterprise job requirements.

---

## Key Highlights
This project demonstrates expertise and hands-on application of the skills sought in enterprise Java roles:

### Core Java & Spring Boot
- Developed in **Java 8+** with clean, modular, and maintainable code.
- Deep use of **Spring Boot** for REST APIs, dependency injection, configuration management, and service orchestration.
- **Hibernate/JPA** integration for persistence with entity relationships and repository patterns.

### Web & API Experience
- Exposes **RESTful web services** for account operations.
- Designed with extensibility for **SOAP-based integration** (pluggable service interfaces).
- Uses **XML/JSON** as data interchange formats with clear DTO separation.
- Follows **SDLC best practices**: requirements → design → build → test → deploy.

### Enterprise Deployment & Build Tools
- **Maven** build lifecycle with profiles for dev/prod.
- Dockerized microservice for **containerization**.
- **Kubernetes manifests** for orchestration and scaling in clustered environments.
- Deployable to **OpenShift** or other enterprise-grade Kubernetes platforms.
- CI/CD ready with **Atlassian Suite (Bitbucket/Jenkins/Bamboo)** integrations.

### Middleware & Messaging (Extensible)
- Built to support **JMS** queues (Tibco EMS, ActiveMQ, or RabbitMQ) for async communication.
- Scheduling support extendable with **Quartz/Flux** for batch jobs.

### DevOps & System Engineering
- Container images built using Spring Boot buildpacks.
- Deployable to **Linux environments** with Apache or LVS.
- Agile-driven: small, iterative, and deployable increments.
- Supports monitoring extensions with Micrometer/Prometheus.

---

## Project Features
- **Account Management Service**: REST endpoints to manage account data.
- **Spring Data JPA & Hibernate**: ORM mapping and database persistence.
- **Exception Handling & Validation**: Centralized error handling for clean responses.
- **Docker Integration**: Packaged as a self-contained container for portability.
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Scalable and fault-tolerant service orchestration.
- **Cloud Native Design**: Built with stateless principles and microservice readiness.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 11+
- Maven 3.6+
- Docker
- Kubernetes Cluster (Minikube, Docker Desktop, or OpenShift)

### Run Locally
```bash
cd bankwave/accounts
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Build & Run with Docker
```bash
mvn spring-boot:build-image -Dspring-boot.build-image.imageName=bankwave/accounts

docker run -p 8080:8080 bankwave/accounts
```

### Deploy to Kubernetes
```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml
```

---

## Architecture
- **Spring Boot** for application framework
- **REST APIs** for communication
- **Hibernate/JPA** for persistence
- **Docker** for containerization
- **Kubernetes** for orchestration & scaling
- **Atlassian CI/CD** compatibility for automated build/deploy

---

## Future Enhancements
- **Swagger/OpenAPI** for auto-generated API documentation.
- **Resilience4j** for fault tolerance.
- **Centralized Config Management** with Spring Cloud Config.
- **Distributed Tracing** with Sleuth + Zipkin.
- **Authentication/Authorization** with OAuth2 & JWT.
- **Angular/React Presentation Layer** for UI integration.

---

## Why This Project Stands Out
This project highlights **direct alignment with enterprise requirements**:
- Real-world **Spring Boot + Hibernate** microservice.
- Fully **containerized with Docker** and **orchestrated with Kubernetes**.
- Deployable to **JBoss/WebLogic** or containerized environments.
- Integrates **REST, XML, and SOAP services** principles.
- Follows **DevOps pipelines, Agile practices, and SDLC discipline**.
- Ready for **scaling in a complex, high-pressure environment**.

---

## Conclusion
Bankwave - Accounts Microservice demonstrates not only technical proficiency in **Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, Docker, and Kubernetes** but also readiness for real-world enterprise challenges: high availability, scalability, and deployment in demanding environments.
